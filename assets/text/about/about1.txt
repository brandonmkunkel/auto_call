Traditional Turkish Coffee is brewed with the grounds mixed into the water (optionally with sugar) and brought to a boil in a copper pot, called an ibrik.

The coffee is served with the grounds in a small cup. Once the liquids have been fully enjoyed, the cup is inverted and the grounds settle into interesting shapes.

The grounds hold images and patterns that may reveal insights into your life.
